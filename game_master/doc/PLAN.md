# Game Plan
## Nevzat Sevim


### Breakout Variant
For the breakout game project, I will attempt to recreate the Atari 2600 version of the game. I want to do this version
as a tribute to the original arcade version. I also like rainbow colors of the bricks and how the bricks look like a 
single unity at the beginning of the game.

### General Level Descriptions
As stated above I will try to recreate Atari 2600 version of the game. So the the levels will include 6 lines of bricks 
with 6 different colors. I have 3 ideas of what to do with the levels of the game. I will either add more rows to clear, 
make the paddle smaller, or make the ball more faster with each successive level. 

### Bricks Ideas
The bricks are going to be uniform shape of rectangle. There won't be spaces between the bricks so that the six lines of
bricks will look like a single unity at first. Every row will bear differently colored bricks so, the entire structure
will resemble a rainbow at first. 


### Power Up Ideas

There are so many power up ideas that I might add into the game; however I am unsure which ones will actually make it
into the game: <br>
-Make the paddle longer. <br> 
-Make the ball move slower. <br> 
-A fire ball that destroys more than one brick. <br> 
-A ball that pierces through bricks. <br> 
-Multiple balls.

### Cheat Key Ideas
Again I don't know which one of these ideas I will be able to code, but here are the ideas:

-Add an extra life. <br> 
-Make the paddle as long as the ground. <br> 
-Directly skip to next level. <br> 
-Delete a random block.  <br> 


### Something Extra

Getting everything I have planned working is something extra for someone of with my coding skills. However; if I manage
to get everything going fine, I will try to create a game mode where a new line of bricks are generated after a certain
amount of hits with the paddle. Once the new bricks are created, the already existing ones will get closer to the ground.
This would make the game a lot more challenging and exciting to play because the player would know that each shot counts.
If this idea turns out to be too challenging, I might try to create a leaderboard with high scores written in there.
