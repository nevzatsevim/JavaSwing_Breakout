### Timeline

Start Date:  January 17, 2020

My game is a lot different from this game but it laid a foundation for my game. <br>

### Running the Program

Main class: <br> Main

Data files needed:<br> I have added many .png files to create visuals; these were the only files I needed.

Key/Mouse inputs: <br>The game is played by using the left and right arrow keys.
<br>As an additional feature to the paddle you can use up and down keys for vertical movement.
<br>The paddle goes faster if you hold the arrows down. (compared to a quick press and release)
<br>The ball bounces differently depending on where you hit it with the paddle. 

Cheat keys: <br> press "1,2,3" to toggle between levels
<br> press "r" to reset ball and pedal
<br> press "l" for extra lives
<br> press up and down arrows to fly with your paddle

Power Ups: There are three power ups for each level, the attributes are randomly decided between the following
<br> make the ball twice as large
<br> make the paddle twice as large
<br> make the paddle twice as fast

Brick Types: 
<br> frame brick = one hit will destroy and worths 1 point
<br> filled brick = two hits will destroy and worths 1 point
<br> diamonf = one hit will destroy, but worths 5 poins (also harder to hit)

Known Bugs:
If you toggle between the levels too many times, the game will start to slow down or crash. The paddle will also get harder to control

Extra credit:
I dont know if this counts but I made the game look actually pretty nice by using many png images.
I also added all the cool features I mentioned above and made sure good brick and paddle physics applied to the game.


### Notes/Assumptions
I learned a lot about objcects and classes during this project. 
I did not previously know how to create a interactive program and learned that jframe (and panel,button...) were easy to use tools to accomplish that.
Allthough I eventually uploaded to git in one go, I beacame more confident in using git.


### Impressions
I have never created a game before and at first I sruggled to get going.
However, once I cought the wind and understood what was going on, I really enjoyed my work.
I am pleased with the end product and hope you will be too.
